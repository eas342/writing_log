2017-11-11
	More inspection of Chimera - why is this template taking so long to converge?
	
2017-11-15
	Started incorporating the CK trans model into genplanet_trans. Started incorporating parameter-changing capabilities.

2017-12-02
	More troubleshooting Multinest Installation

2017-12-03
	After, in my view, an enormous amount of effort, installed pymultinest on Ocelote using correct mpi4py.

2017-12-04
	Spent all day fiddling with Multinest and CHIMERA to get it to converge for the forecasts paper.

2017-12-08
	Got the new CK code mostly incorporated in a general way. STILL NEED TO READ IN THE CORRECT STELLAR SPECTRUM though.

2017-12-09
	Updated the CK emission code to read the correct stellar spectrum from current_planet_parms. Also wrote out the scientific goals in the Intro.

2017-12-10
	Started adjusting the CK emission template so we can see the contributions from each molecules. Something isn't work with it yet.

2017-12-11

2017-12-24
	Used the parameter script to create runs for all GTO targets and started them all on Ocelote. It's letting me run 5 jobs on 4 nodes each for a total of 560 CPUs at once! Probably because its a holiday.

2017-12-27
	Made a preliminary mass-metallicity plot from the multinest results.

2017-12-28

	Analyzed WASP-80 b transmission run and it still hasn't found the truth nor do the likelihoods approach the correct chi-squared = 1.

2018-01-07
	Analyzed 10 percent efficiency mode. Now there's an island of probability closer to the truth but its still a little wonky. Starting a run without constant efficieny mode.

2018-01-09
